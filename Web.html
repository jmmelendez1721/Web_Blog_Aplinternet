		<p class="text">Guitar Hero is a rhythm-based music video game series that gained immense popularity in the mid-2000s. In the game, players use a guitar-shaped controller to simulate playing along with various rock songs by pressing colored buttons corresponding to notes that scroll down the screen. The objective is to hit the notes accurately to keep the virtual crowd entertained and advance through the song. Guitar Hero features a variety of game modes, including career mode where players progress through different venues and unlock new songs and characters. The franchise has spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs, becoming a cultural phenomenon and influencing the music gaming genre.</p>
